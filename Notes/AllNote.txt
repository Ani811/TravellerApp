Handling Deletion
using Mongoose Middleware

We can use 2 middleware:
=>Pre-run before the query is executed
=>Post-run after the query is executed

customerSchema.post("findOneAndDelete",async(customer)=>{
    if(customer.orders.length){
        let res=await Order.deleteMany({_id:{$in:customer.orders}});
        console.log(res);
    }
})

Express Router:
    Express Routers are a way to organize your Express application such that our
    primary app.js file does not become bloated.

const router=express.Router()   //create new router object

//From documentations


Router
A router object is an instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.

A router behaves like middleware itself, so you can use it as an argument to app.use() or as the argument to another router’s use() method.

The top-level express object has a Router() method that creates a new router object.

Once you’ve created a router object, you can add middleware and HTTP method routes (such as get, put, post, and so on) to it just like an application. For example:

// invoked for any requests passed to this router
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  // .. some logic here .. like any other middleware
  next()
})

// will handle any request that ends in /events
// depends on where the router is "use()'d"
router.get('/events', (req, res, next) => {
  // ..
})
